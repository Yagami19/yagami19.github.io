## Description

This is a project which I have done to pass a class with UWP and server setup. 

It has practical purposes and helps calculate the amount of food that a cat should eat.

The idea came to my head because I have a cat that tends to be overweight and I used it to help her in getting fit.

I have pushed the project to github recently as it was relatively small and I had only used it locally.

Sadly due to the Visual Studio limitations the local WCF server wouldn't compile so I had to start it manually each time. 

Now I would rather use Unity or any other application because using dedicated WCF server is useless for this type of endeavour.

## Screenshots
  
{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="9999" number="1" %}

Screenshots showcase the app with basic, high contrast look that was made only by editing xml and not using any assets.

They also capture spirit of the application and how it handles different important factors in feeding a cat.

It works by first calculating Caloric requirement based on cat body type, and it's weight. Then calculates how caloric is potential food, and at last how much grams per day specific cat should eat.

## Code snippets

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="9999" number="2" %}

First snippet showcase operation contact with the Server.

Second method that scales application to the 16:9 size based on external dependency.

Rest showcase how different methods that handle buttons, calculations and data validation.
