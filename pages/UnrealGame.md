## Description

This is a game made with Unreal Engine and its blueprint system.

It is arena shooter prototype that has one basic enemy and few active player skills in this example healing ability, movement speed boost and ultimate which is big explosion.

Game also has passive energy (mana) and health regeneration system.

I have also used (not fitting with the rest of the style) interface based on diablo-like games.

## Additional information

There is no github link or code snippets as both project and the build are too big to be imported (20gb's). 

To construct this project I have used free assets from multiple sites and Unreal Store.
