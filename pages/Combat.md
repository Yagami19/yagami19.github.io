## Description

This project was an attempt to recreate classic game from 1980's called COMBAT

It was made to pass a semester in Unity3D programming course

It also was my first attempt to create full playable game from scratch 

The project focused of creating rough AI for flying starships and a way to manipulate starship in 3D space

## Screenshots

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="9999" number="1" %}

On screenshots there is fully working main menu with basic functions. The game does not look super exciting but it was made with only basic assets in Unity3D.

It has fully functional, robust AI, Score system and obstacles that player has to navigate.

## Code snippets

In first two screens there is basic concept on how AI works. It fires a raycast and then if that raycast collides with a wall then it rotates opponent and if it collides with player it sets AI on player's direction.

Next two are how I handled resolution change in Unity3D. 

Last one is really simple script that handles the pause menu.
