## Description

This project was made as an practical application of non enclidean geometry and was made for my Bachelor's degree.

It works similar to portals in the Portal series games.

Work can be expanded to create fully functional game.

## Screenshots
  
{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="9999" number="1" %}
  
Screenshots showcase portals in work and some level concepts. It is hard to capture the essence of the project as video would be needed.

## Code snippets

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="9999" number="2" %}

Scripts show usage of second camera and render texture to give the portal illusion and how it behaves when player moves around it. After that there is a simple teleport function in Unity3D that moves player across space.
