## Description

This project is an attempt to make a procedural level generation script that can be then used to make levels in a group project web/android game.

It functions as a proof of concept and was successfully used by the rest of the team.

I have learned that this method is really ineffective (too many arrays, too many loops and too many conditional statements) made generation process take too much time on both in web and mobile.

Even though I learned a lot about how to setup things in Unity and how to make project that can be easily transferred to another one.

## Screenshots
  
{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="9999" number="1" %}

Screeshots demonstrate how generation process works with placeholders. They can be then changed to any prefabs. 

They also demonstrate different size of the levels, rooms and parameters to control level generation from inspector. 

For more information check the github link below, as code snippets were not included because project being one long script.
